## Problem Statement
Accessing timely medical advice remains a challenge, particularly in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure or outside regular office hours. This leads to delays in seeking appropriate care, unnecessary ER visits, and increased healthcare costs. Misinformation online adds to patient anxiety and risky self-diagnosis.


## Goal
Our aim is to create a medical chatbot which should triage symptoms efficiently, understand different medical conditions, assess severity, and offer personalized recommendations based on user profiles.

## Features
1. The chatbot asks users about their symptoms in a conversational manner and use this information to suggest potential conditions or recommend appropriate next steps.

2. Users can interact with the chatbot by speaking instead of typing, making the interaction more convenient.

3. A good application with nice user interface has been developed.

4. User has the option to give input in both text and speech formats.

5. It has a very great feature of assistance in the emergency situations. In case of an emergency, patients are given immediate assistance.

6. It suggests you with all the medicines on the basis of the symptoms,the patient is suffering with.

## Tech Stack

1. We have fed a medical textbook to the Pinecone database.
2. Hugging Face -Llama-2 model
3. Flask for backend
4. HTML and CSS for frontend 
5. PyPDF
6. Google Text-to-Speech (gtts)
7. Playsound (for playing audio)
8. Java Script (For Speech Recognition)
## Installing the requirements

First, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system, including Python and any required libraries or frameworks specified in the requirements file.

Next, clone the project repository from our GitHub page or download the source code package from our website. Once you have the project files on your local machine, navigate to the project directory using the command line or terminal. Then, create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and isolate them from other Python projects on your system. Activate the virtual environment and install the required dependencies using pip or another package manager.

After installing dependencies, you can start using the chatbot application by running the main script or entry point specified in the project's documentation. 
Please use the same API as we have used because we have fed a textbook to a database. 

## How to run

Run the python code and navigate to the html file generated.

1.	Starting the Conversation: Begin by typing a greeting or message into the chat interface and press enter to start talking to the Medical Chatbot.
2.	Introduction and Initial Inquiry: Once you start the conversation, the chatbot named ManasMythri will introduce itself and ask how it can help you. It will also ask if it's an emergency situation, so it can provide immediate assistance if needed.
3.	Emergency Assistance: If it's an urgent situation, reply "yes". The chatbot will then prompt you to describe the symptoms and condition of the patient. Provide all the relevant details, and the chatbot will offer appropriate guidance and support.
4.	Non-Emergency Inquiry: If it's not an emergency, reply "no". The chatbot will then proceed to do a detailed diagnosis of the patient's condition.
5.	Patient History: The chatbot will ask for the patient's past medical history to better understand their condition.
6.	Current Symptoms: Next, the chatbot will inquire about the patient's current symptoms to further refine its diagnosis.  If available, you can provide test reports to the chatbot in a text message, along with current symptoms. This allows the chatbot to offer more accurate advice based on additional information.
7.	Detailed Diagnosis: Based on the information provided, the chatbot will offer a detailed diagnosis of the patient's condition, providing recommendations or next steps as necessary.
8.	After the diagnosis the session ends. For further assistance, restart the python code and follow the same steps again.

## Applications of our idea
A medical chatbot has multiple real life applications.

1. It helps patients in providing the primary care. It includes providing initial symptom assessment, guidance, offering basic health education and preventive care information.

2. It is extremely useful in emergency assistance. The chatbot can guide the patients through first aid procedures, contacting emergency services and providing support until help arrives. This has the potential to save many lives.

3. It is useful in health monitoring and tracking. Once users give their health data, the chatbot can analyze this data, providing insights into the health trends and potential areas for improvement.

4. Now-a-days people are facing higher stress levels. A medical chatbot can provide mental health support by offering resources for managing stress, anxiety and depression. This will be helpful for many people.

5. It is useful in medication management. It reminds patients to take their medications on time.


## Further Improvements
While our current medical chat bot lacks integration with mapping services, we envision significant advancements in this area. Our team is committed to enhancing patient care by seamlessly incorporating mapping functionalities into our platform. By integrating with maps, we aim to provide users with valuable assistance in locating nearby specialized healthcare professionals. This feature will be particularly crucial during emergencies, ensuring swift access to critical care facilities when needed most. We are dedicated to evolving our project to meet the dynamic demands of healthcare delivery, and we are excited to implement these advancements in the near future.
